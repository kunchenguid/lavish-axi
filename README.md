HTML is the new markdown. Lavish is the new editor for your HTML artifacts.

Agents are good at producing rich HTML artifacts, but the human-agent collaboration loop on such artifacts is lacking and falls back into screenshots and long responses for “tell me what to change.”
That loses the thing HTML is best at: interactivity.

Lavish Editor opens agent-generated HTML files in a local browser, lets you pinpoint elements or selected text and send feedback to the agent to address.

- **Local only** - Work with your local HTML artifacts with a local CLI. Zero cloud dependency.
- **Human-AI collaboration** - Annotate elements, selected text ranges, and send messages to the agent without leaving Lavish Editor.
- **Battery included** - Lavish Editor teaches your agent good visualization for common use cases such as product or technical plans, design explorations and more out of the box.

Lavish Editor is an [AXI](https://axi.md), which means -

- It's just a CLI any capable agent can run without setup.
- It's optimized for agent ergonomics. TOON output, long polling, and contextual disclosure making it highly token efficient.
- The skill and hooks below only handle discovery; agents learn to use the AXI by using it.

## Quick Start

Install the Lavish skill in the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format with [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```sh
npx skills add kunchenguid/lavish-axi --skill lavish
```

That is the entire setup - no npm install needed.
The skill teaches your agent to run Lavish through `npx -y lavish-axi`, so the CLI comes along on demand.
Its frontmatter also includes Hermes Agent metadata, so Hermes-compatible harnesses can categorize and surface it as a first-class productivity skill.

Then, in agents that expose skills as slash commands (Claude Code, for example), invoke it directly:

```
/lavish let's discuss our plan here
```

Or just ask for anything that is easier to grasp visually - a plan, comparison, diagram, table, code view, or report - and the agent loads the skill on its own when it recognizes the task.

By default the skill lands in the current project's skills directory (`.claude/skills/`, for example); add `-g` to install it for all projects (`~/.claude/skills/`).

## Other Ways to Use Lavish

The skill is the recommended path, but it is not the only one.

### Zero setup

Lavish is an AXI, so any capable agent can run the CLI directly with nothing installed at all.
Just tell your agent:

```
Use `npx lavish-axi` to write a product or technical plan for what we discussed.
```

### Session hook

Want Lavish's ambient context - including your live open sessions - fed into every agent session instead of loading on demand?
Install the CLI globally and opt into the hook:

```sh
npm install -g lavish-axi
lavish-axi setup hooks
```

This installs a `SessionStart` hook for **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **OpenCode** that surfaces open sessions, visualization playbooks, and usage guidance at the start of each session.
Unlike the skill, the hook also shows your live open sessions, so a fresh agent session can resume an in-flight review.
**Restart your agent session after running this** so the new hook takes effect.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/lavish-axi.git
cd lavish-axi
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
pnpm link
```

```

- **File-path identity** - Sessions are keyed by the canonical HTML file path, so agents do not need opaque IDs.
- **Portable artifacts** - The artifact runs in an iframe while Lavish injects a small SDK for annotations, snapshots, and feedback controls.
  Lavish does not inject any design system, so the saved HTML file renders identically whether you open it through `lavish-axi` or directly in a browser.
  Before writing HTML, choose a design system in strict priority order: follow a user-requested look first; otherwise inspect the current project for a Tailwind or theme config, CSS variables or design tokens, a component library, brand assets, or existing styled pages and match what you find; only when both come up empty, run `lavish-axi design` for a copy-pasteable Tailwind CSS v4 + DaisyUI v5 CDN fallback.
  That fallback guidance recommends DaisyUI's `luxury` theme by default and warns not to `@apply` DaisyUI classes inside Tailwind browser-runtime style blocks.
- **Local assets** - Copy local images, CSS, fonts, and scripts next to the HTML artifact and reference them with relative paths from that directory; root-prefixed paths such as `/assets/logo.png` will not resolve through Lavish's artifact route.
- **Live reload** - Lavish watches the HTML artifact file by default and preserves the artifact iframe scroll position across reloads. To also reload on sibling asset changes, add `data-lavish-live-reload-root` to the root element or `<meta name="lavish-live-reload" content="root">`.
- **Feedback controls** - Native form controls (radios, checkboxes, inputs, selects, buttons, labels, contenteditable) are interactive automatically, so they do not need `data-lavish-action`; wire their handlers to `window.lavish.queuePrompt()` or `window.lavish.sendQueuedPrompts()` to send feedback.
  Mark only custom (non-native) clickable elements with `data-lavish-action` so Lavish does not annotate them.
  The browser chrome keeps editing actions in the overflow menu (copy path, reload artifact, copy DOM snapshot, end session) and can submit queued prompts with **Send & end session**, which delivers the prompts before ending the session.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - In the chrome composer, Enter sends queued prompts and Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
  In the annotation card, Enter queues the annotation, Shift+Enter inserts a newline, and Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on macOS) queues it and sends all queued prompts immediately.
- **Agent presence** - The browser shows when no agent is listening, keeps queued feedback for the next successful `lavish-axi poll` send even across reloads, and only blocks sending while the agent is working on delivered feedback. The no-timeout poll writes an immediate stderr banner and periodic stderr heartbeats while stdout stays reserved for the final response; if the poll is interrupted or times out, re-run it because queued feedback is never lost.
- **Precise targets** - Text annotations include selected text plus range anchors, so agents are not limited to whole-element selectors.
- **Server cleanup** - The detached server stops after the last session ends when nothing is connected, or after `LAVISH_AXI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30 minutes) with no browser or poll connections.
  Set `LAVISH_AXI_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=0` or `off` to disable idle self-shutdown.
- **Local-first state** - Session state stays under `.lavish-axi/` in the workspace.
- **Network binding** - The server binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) by default. Set `LAVISH_AXI_HOST` to bind elsewhere; a wildcard (`0.0.0.0` or `::`) binds every interface. Binding beyond loopback exposes an unauthenticated server that can read and serve arbitrary local files to anything that can reach it, so only do so on a trusted network. Set `LAVISH_AXI_LINK_HOST` to control the hostname written into generated session links (defaults to the bind address, or loopback when bound to a wildcard).

Known playbook IDs: `diagram`, `table`, `comparison`, `plan`, `code`, `input`, `slides`.
One artifact often combines several playbooks, such as a plan that includes a comparison and a diagram, so read every playbook relevant to the artifact for the best quality.
